- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Firewall**: Configure proper firewall rules
3. **Updates**: Keep all dependencies and systems updated
4. **Monitoring**: Implement proper logging and monitoring

### API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement additional rate limiting if needed
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Logging**: Log security events appropriately

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- **GDPR Compliance**: Data handling follows GDPR requirements where applicable
